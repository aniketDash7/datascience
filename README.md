### Some of my work and implementations 
Here, I document concepts I find interesting and how I use them to build things. 
( And everthing cool about generative AI ) 

### Toxic Comment Classification Interface
January 2024
#### Go through the whole project [here](https://aniketdash7.github.io/toxic_comment_classifier/)
The data consisted of comments and sparse representation of various features visible in the comments. Comments are sparsely described through features like 'toxic',
'severe-toxic', 'obscene', 'threat', 'insult', 'identity-hate'. If a comment is, say, obscene then the feature gets a '1' and all the remaining features get zeroes.   

### Enhancing Business Efficiency and Customer Experience for Ali's Shawarma Truck through data analysis. 
October 2023 - February 2024
#### Go through the whole project [here](https://aniketdash7.github.io/business_data_management/)
- Sales data was collected primarily for 56 days starting from October 10th 2023 - December 5th 2023 from a local shawarma food truck. Data was cleaned and preprocessed for analysis using **pandas**.
  Popular choice or item from the menu was determined after examining the revenue, profit generation and the units sold.
- It was roughly noticed that the sales of spicier products on the menu went up with the temperature drop. So **temperature variation analysis** was conducted by collecting weather
  data of concerned dates. It was concluded that temperature drop has relationship with sales of spicier products because people tend to eat food which is more likely to make them perspire as a mechanism
  to keep them warm.
- Sales data was checked against the holiday list of nearby university to conclude that the customer-base of the business largely composed of students of the university.The street doesn’t have any traffic signal      and it’s fairly wide allowing two-way movement of vehicles. The movement of vehicles is usually quite speedy. Parking at the side of the street results in immediate towing of the vehicle.
- Recommendations include optimizing chicken quantity estimations, optimizing location for increased visibility, and investing in online delivery partnerships. By adjusting chicken quantity estimations based on       menu performance, significant cost savings are projected, leading to a notable increase in profit margin.
- The new value for the cost of chicken made the profit and the profit margin jump from **₹1,06,540** and **39.25%** to **₹1,36,464.99** and **50.27%** respectively. The profit goes up by **₹29,924** and the profit-margin by **11.02 %**.
  The new location is adjacent to a huge car parking spot which directly catches the eye of people parking there. This opens up the avenue to diversify the customer-base of the business.
